                <p> Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical goals, especially in a reproducible way.The 
        
                    word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,including both tangible tools such as utensils or 
                    machines, and intangible ones such as software.Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.<br> 
                    Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society.The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used 
                    during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the 
                    development of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the 
                    creation of more complex machines.More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the 
                    Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.While technology contributes to 
                    economic development and improves human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource 
                    depletion, and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a result, there are 
                    ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to 
                    mitigate its downsides.
